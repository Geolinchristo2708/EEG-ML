The increasing prevalence of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and other brain-related conditions, presents a significant challenge to healthcare systems globally. These conditions are often diagnosed using EEG (Electroencephalography), which records electrical activity in the brain. However, interpreting EEG signals requires skilled professionals, and the process is time-consuming, subjective, and prone to human error. Additionally, the complexity of EEG data, which contains noise and high-dimensional features, makes it difficult to analyze effectively using traditional methods.
In many cases, early detection of neurological disorders is critical for preventing the progression of the disease and implementing timely interventions. However, the current diagnostic methods lack automation and efficiency, leading to delayed diagnoses and suboptimal patient outcomes. Moreover, the manual analysis of EEG signals is not only labor-intensive but also vulnerable to inconsistencies in interpretation across different specialists.
The primary problem addressed by this project is the lack of an efficient, automated system that can accurately classify EEG data to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with neurological disorders. The challenges are as follows:
1.	High Dimensionality: EEG signals contain a large number of features, making it difficult to handle and analyze without significant computational resources.
2.	Noise and Artifacts: EEG data can contain noise and artifacts that hinder accurate classification, and current methods do not effectively filter and preprocess this data for improved analysis.
3.	Subjectivity in Diagnosis: Manual interpretation of EEG data can vary significantly between healthcare professionals, which may lead to inconsistent results and misdiagnoses.
4.	Limited Real-Time Analysis: The lack of real-time automated systems for EEG signal classification results in delays in diagnosis and treatment, which can be detrimental to patient health.
